    "### üìù Questions for Reflection\n",
    "1. How is prompt chaining similar to solving a jigsaw puzzle?  \n",
    "like a jigsaw each prompt is a piece you fit together, i break big jobs into extract ‚Üí summarize ‚Üí assemble steps and fix only the broken piece when something wrong, i do this with RAG flows using LangChain and FAISS\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What‚Äôs the main difference between **iteration** and **chaining**?  \n",
    "iteration = tweak the same prompt till its ok, chaining = make many small linked prompts and feed outputs forward, chaining is how i build pipelines like outline ‚Üí sources ‚Üí draft\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why might prompt chaining be more effective than asking AI one big question?  \n",
    "one big ask gives long messy output thats hard to control, chaining gives checkpoints so i verify sources, catch errors early and reuse intermediates\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How can the **context window** of an AI model affect your chaining strategy?  \n",
    "if model window is small i chunk inputs and persist results in a vector DB then retrieve whats needed, if window is big i keep more steps inline so fewer external calls, i usually use LangChain + vector store to manage this"

    "\n",
    "### Exercises: Try It Yourself ‚ùó\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 1: Build a Project Step-by-Step\n",
    "1. Pick a multi-step project (e.g., marketing campaign, event planning).  \n",
    "2. Chain three prompts: outline, expand a section, create an activity/visual.  \n",
    "   - Example: *Outline a team training program, expand one module, suggest an interactive exercise.*\n",
    "#### prompt:\n",
    "Outline a SindhuGPT community onboarding event, expand one session into detailed content, then suggest a visual or interactive activity for participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 2: CoT for Clarity\n",
    "1. Choose a task requiring logic (e.g., budgeting, scheduling).  \n",
    "2. Prompt AI to explain its reasoning step-by-step.  \n",
    "   - Example: *Allocate a 2,000 budget for a team event. Explain your reasoning*\n",
    "#### prompt:\n",
    "Allocate a $1,000 budget for SindhuGPT‚Äôs first community workshop. Explain your reasoning step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 3: ToT for Creativity\n",
    "1. Pick a creative task (e.g., branding, content ideas).  \n",
    "2. Prompt AI to propose three solutions and evaluate them.  \n",
    "   - Example: *‚ÄúSuggest three social media campaign ideas. Evaluate each for engagement.‚Äù*\n",
    "#### prompt:\n",
    "Suggest three logo concepts for SindhuGPT, evaluate each for clarity and cultural appeal, and recommend the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 4: Combine CoT and ToT\n",
    "1. Use ToT to explore options for a project.  \n",
    "2. Use CoT to refine the best option with detailed reasoning.  \n",
    "   - Example: *‚ÄúPropose three event formats, evaluate them, then plan the best one with step-by-step reasoning.‚Äù*\n",
    "#### prompt\n",

    "### ‚úÖ Reflection Question üí°\n",
    "How could prompt chaining help you **simplify a complex project** or **improve collaboration** in your workplace?  \n",
    "prompt chaining helps me break big projects into smaller steps making them easier to manage and collaborate on with others\n"
