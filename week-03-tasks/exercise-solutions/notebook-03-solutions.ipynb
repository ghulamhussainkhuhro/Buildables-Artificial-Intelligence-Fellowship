    "### üìù Questions for Reflection\n",
    "1. How is prompt chaining similar to solving a jigsaw puzzle?  \n",
    "like a jigsaw each prompt is a piece you fit together, i break big jobs into extract ‚Üí summarize ‚Üí assemble steps and fix only the broken piece when something wrong, i do this with RAG flows using LangChain and FAISS\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What‚Äôs the main difference between **iteration** and **chaining**?  \n",
    "iteration = tweak the same prompt till its ok, chaining = make many small linked prompts and feed outputs forward, chaining is how i build pipelines like outline ‚Üí sources ‚Üí draft\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why might prompt chaining be more effective than asking AI one big question?  \n",
    "one big ask gives long messy output thats hard to control, chaining gives checkpoints so i verify sources, catch errors early and reuse intermediates\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How can the **context window** of an AI model affect your chaining strategy?  \n",
    "if model window is small i chunk inputs and persist results in a vector DB then retrieve whats needed, if window is big i keep more steps inline so fewer external calls, i usually use LangChain + vector store to manage this"
