    "* learned prompt chaining: break big tasks into small prompts (outline → expand → activity) so outputs are easier to control\n",
    "* used Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to make the model show reasoning step-by-step for decisions and budgets\n",
    "* used Tree-of-Thought (ToT) to explore multiple creative paths and compare them before choosing one\n",
    "* practised building agents: AgentSim (roleplay + feedback) and AgentX (expert feedback) with stop phrases and takeaways\n",
    "* wrote meta-prompts and started a prompt library for reusing/refining prompts (v1, v2, notes)\n",
    "* applied everything to a real project (SindhuGPT): planning mvp, outreach, onboarding, logo and budget prompts\n",
    "* tooling notes: use LangChain + vector DB (FAISS/Pinecone) for long chains and storing intermediates, Streamlit for demos\n",
    "* main takeaway: chain + inspect + iterate — humans must review outputs, dont blindly trust models\n",
