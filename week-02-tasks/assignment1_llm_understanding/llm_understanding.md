# Assignment 1: LLM Understanding

Large Language Models (LLMs) can be divided into three main types:

1. **Encoder-only models (e.g., BERT)**  
   - Focus on *understanding text*.  
   - They are good at tasks like classification, embeddings, and sentiment analysis.  
   - ðŸ‘‰ Example: Using BERT to classify whether a product review is positive or negative.  

2. **Decoder-only models (e.g., GPT, LLaMA, Mistral)**  
   - Focus on *generating text*.  
   - They excel at tasks like chatbots, story writing, and summarization.  
   - ðŸ‘‰ Example: Using GPT to build a chatbot that answers open-ended questions.  

3. **Encoder-decoder models (e.g., T5, BART)**  
   - Focus on *transforming text*.  
   - They are strong in translation, summarization, and Q&A tasks.  
   - ðŸ‘‰ Example: Using T5 to translate English sentences into French.  

**Summary:**  
Encoder-only = understanding, Decoder-only = generation, Encoder-decoder = transformation.
