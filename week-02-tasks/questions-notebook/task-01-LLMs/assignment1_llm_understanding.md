# Assignment 1: LLM Understanding

Large Language Models (LLMs) can be grouped into three types:

1. **Encoder-only models (e.g., BERT)**  
   - Focused on *understanding text*.  
   - Example usage: Sentiment analysis, text classification.  

2. **Decoder-only models (e.g., GPT, LLaMA, Mistral)**  
   - Focused on *generating text*.  
   - Example usage: Chatbots, story generation, code writing.  

3. **Encoder-decoder models (e.g., T5, BART)**  
   - Best for *transforming text from one form to another*.  
   - Example usage: Translation, summarization, Q&A.  

Key difference: Encoder-only = understanding, Decoder-only = generation, Encoder-decoder = transformation.
