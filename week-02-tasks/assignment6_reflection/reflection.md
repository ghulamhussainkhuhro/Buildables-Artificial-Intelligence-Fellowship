# Assignment 6: Reflection

**Q1: Why is context memory important in chatbots?**  
Context memory allows chatbots to “remember” past user inputs, which makes conversations more natural and coherent. Without memory, the chatbot would treat every input as isolated, breaking the flow and frustrating users.

**Q2: Why should beginners always check API limits and pricing?**  
APIs often have strict usage limits or costs attached. Beginners should check these early to avoid unexpected charges and to design their projects within safe usage boundaries.
